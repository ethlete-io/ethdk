Grid: add `GridItemToolbarComponent` (`et-grid-item-toolbar`), a themeable container for per-item controls (edit, remove, …). Drop it into an item's action slot and project action buttons (e.g. `IconButtonComponent`) into it. It stops pointerdown so the toolbar is never a drag surface even when the whole item is draggable, and is themeable via the `--et-grid-item-toolbar-background` / `-gap` / `-padding` / `-radius` custom properties. Exported from the grid entrypoint and included in `GridImports`.
