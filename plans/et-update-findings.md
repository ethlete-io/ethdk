# `et update` findings from fifagg-frontend

Reported on 2026-10-30 by the session `fifagg-frontend-a5`, with `@ethlete/cli` 3.0.0-next.23 and
`@ethlete/core` 5.0.0-next.69. Tom: the Studio builder session does these, in its queue.

## 1. Codemods fail without `ts-morph` - open

- **Pain:** `yarn et update --tag next` failed in the codemod `@ethlete/core surface-interaction-swatch`:
  "Cannot find package 'ts-morph' imported from
  node_modules/@ethlete/core/generators/migrate-surface-interaction-swatch/interaction-swatch.js".
- **Cause:** `ts-morph` is only an optional peer of `@ethlete/core`, and `et update` does not install it. Five
  core generators import it: interaction-swatch, legacy-color-themes, tailwind-4-surface-theme,
  tailwind-4-color-theme, color-theme-variants.
- **Fix options:** `et update` installs `ts-morph` before it runs a codemod that needs it, or the generator fails
  with a clear "add ts-morph" message.

## 2. `et update --continue` commits foreign changes - open

- **Pain:** the user ran `yarn add -D ts-morph` and did not commit it. `yarn et update --continue` then put the
  `package.json` and `yarn.lock` change into its own commit "chore(deps): Sync the ethlete agent rules", which
  had no agent-rules change.
- **Fix:** commit only the paths `et update` wrote itself, or refuse on a dirty tree.

## 3. `@nx/devkit` peer range - open

- **Pain:** `@ethlete/core` 5.0.0-next.69 declares the peer `@nx/devkit ^24`, but the migration guide names
  Nx 23.3.1 as the floor.
- **Fix:** make the peer range and the guide agree.
