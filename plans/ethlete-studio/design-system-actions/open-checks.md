# Open: 7. Open checks

## 7. Open checks

These fixes are built, but nobody checked them in the real Studio.

1. The status-watch reload with `et design sketch report` (L1918): the Studio side is verified headless. The Rust side (the watcher) needs the Tauri host and is still unchecked.
2. The `stale` footer (L1980): the Studio side is verified headless. The Rust side (`is_stale`) needs the Tauri host and is still unchecked.
3. Shot size against live size on Tom's HiDPI window (L1214).
4. Round d on macOS WebKit, at 800%, and on touch (L2792).
