281\. B205 + B225 (builder, 2026-11-03, 4247f5042, 21bc27863). B205: SAMPLE-DEFAULT flags `??`/`||`/ternary fallbacks to
sample constants; the real hit is inbox.component.ts:72 `this.draftText() ?? this.DRAFT_TEXT`. Decision: the
line-based match stays; an AST walk only after a real multi-line miss. Not run: a full `design check` with the
final code. B225: the hook ran the specs again because HEAD moved during the run (485dbbd76 landed 2 s before the
commit), so marker tree != staged tree. Why no tool caught it: the B214 spec never had a concurrent commit. Fix:
the hook also skips when the files between marker and staged tree select no specs; `yarn commit` adds untracked
given paths itself. Accepted gap: a mid-run commit whose files select no specs is skipped, the same blind spot
the selection rule has for staged files. Not verified: git-add retry under lock contention.
Title-bar r3 (2026-11-03): Studio asked Tom to rebase for d961cb00d, a declarations-only change that draws
nothing, while `sketch rebase` only rewrites baseline hashes (B220 not built). Lesson: a "needs rebase" signal
says whether the change draws anything. Into B220: rebase ports new states; Studio marks a draw-free base change
as "base refreshed, no visual change" instead of blocking the pick. title-bar is B220's real reproduction.

### Pace decision (2026-11-03)

- Tom: slow down. No new sub-agents until 15:00 today. Running sub-agents finish their current slice and get no
  follow-up. The builder works the queue alone, one slice at a time: TS2345 fix check, then B229, B220
  (title-bar), B227/B228.
- canvas-frames (Tom, 13:09): Tom merged it again in Studio and confirmed it in chat. The tree equals variant c, and
  the merge deleted the sketch dir again, so Tom's chat message is the only record of the pick (B228's second
  repro). The builder commits c together with the `instant` migration and quotes B226's real repro.
- pages/system: Tom gave the go. go.json holds hash 9117d961d91424fa, which is neither the old nor the merged hash.
  The builder checks it before committing.
- canvas-frames: Tom also gave the go. The builder commits it with the pages/system go, after checking the hash.

287\. B198 (builder agent, 2026-11-03, f31d50339). The spec edit adds only a jsdom clientWidth mock, so red-check is
not red. The red proof is the e2e case "first load creates one iframe per frame and aborts no frame request":
HEAD 0/3, fix 3/3. canvas 107/108. Still red: "Large: listing refresh every 1 s for 6 s re-navigates no iframe"
(60 re-navigations). That is a separate refresh-path bug, B232. sketches-tree failed in the full run (reload
47767 ms) and passed alone; load from the parallel canvas suite is the guess, unproven. Why no tool caught the
refresh bug: the e2e case existed and was red, but nothing tied a red e2e case to an open B-item. Rule: a red
e2e case in an e2e-check quote names its B-item, or the report proposes one.

288\. B231 + canvas-frames commit (builder a6, fresh session, 2026-11-03). B231 7f431e9f1: the parser reads top-level
fields only through PARSED_PART_FIELDS, and a spec asserts that list ⊆ keyof Part plus a tsc fixture. ⊆ rather
than == is right, because Part also carries render-only fields the static parser never reads. red-check was not
run (owed). canvas-frames c + instant landed in b0996d580, 4aa34ad7e and 4c0336b02. Tom committed the go
(206b65635). B179's diff landed in dd5ff755d. part-go.spec "stores a go with an open point" failed once inside
`yarn commit` and passed alone; it gets a B-item if it recurs. B221-nobrowser: 7566ed0e9; red-check not proven
(killed twice under load); a full studio check is owed. Three tool decisions (doc-agent, technical):
(1) DROPPED-PROP on canvas-frames: the app component has no `mark` (loading/failed) or `heads` input, so compare
cannot check 4 states. The tool did its job. B233 adds the inputs after B216.
(2) CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION at canvas-frames.ts:100 is a false positive: every branch of the hole starts with
whitespace. B234 lets such a hole pass, and the part stays unchanged after the go.
(3) Stale dist: `nx compile cli` does not refresh dist/libs/cli/design, so a TYPE-ERROR came from a stale build,
and only a separate WARN line said so. B235: with a dist older than its source, `design` exits 2 "dist stale -
nx build cli" before it prints any finding.
