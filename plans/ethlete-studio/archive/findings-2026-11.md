289\. A merge regressed an embedding part unseen (builder, 2026-11-03, full studio check on a fresh dist). Full run:
29 parts, 271 findings, RENDER-TIMEOUT 0, and page-sketch draws, so B221 is done. B230 (50024f9b8) cleared the 13
spec type errors and dropped the filter; its node:test case still owes a red proof. New defect: 20 COVERED
findings sit in pages/system state comment-draft, where canvas-frames c's absolute overlay div covers the comment
draft (2 of 9 points, shot 6 of 25). The `--part elements/canvas-frames` run showed 0 COVERED and GO, so merging
c silently broke pages/system after its go. Why no tool caught it: a part-scoped check never runs the parts that
embed the part. Fix (B236, decided, technical): `design check --part X` also checks every part that embeds X, and
its GO line counts only when they pass as well. B237: Tom looks at pages/system comment-draft in Studio. If there
is a choice in the fix, the builder sketches variants; the pages/system go is then given again.

291\. B209 + B220a (builder, 2026-11-03). B209 07947d6ce: the identical-renders ready rule takes the first changed
state from shot's own pixel diff (shooter.changedBoxesOf) at framesOf()[0]. The behavioural red is quoted. The
real repro (finding 273) did not reproduce, not even on 9e94a2dc3, so its cause is unknown. shot-command.ts still
picks its frame inline. B239 (decided, technical): one shared frame helper for shot and ready. B220a 7e1759fef,
fa830a267: `sketch rebase` ports base changes 3-way per file, finding the old base in git by its baseline hash;
a conflict lists the files, writes nothing and exits 1. `sketch ready` on a ready sketch exits 0 "still ready".
Real repro, title-bar on d961cb00d: f/g/h conflicted on import line 1 although they already held the change, so
the builder added `--ported` (keep the hand-ported files) as an escape. Why no tool caught it: decision 272's
"conflict -> abort" never considered a variant that already holds the change. Into B220b: a conflict resolves on
its own when the variant side holds every line the product added. The rebased sketch is committed as
baseline-only. Tom's stale pick f stays uncommitted; his new pick overwrites it.

292\. Withdrawn variants read as Tom's rejection (builder, 2026-11-03, title-bar). b and e were withdrawn by the
drawing agent ("identisch mit a"). The ready rules skip them on purpose, and a pick refuses them. But
shot-command.ts:200 and Studio label them "rejected", so they read as Tom's own decision, and the shot diff
showed them with no change. Why no tool caught it: the label has one word for two actors. Fix (B240, decided,
technical): shot and Studio label a variant "withdrawn by agent: <reason>" when the agent withdrew it, and
"rejected" only when Tom did. Whether withdrawn variants are shown at all is Tom's product question. The
pickable set for title-bar is a, c, d, f, g, h.

### Withdrawn variant decisions (2026-11-03)

- Tom: an agent-withdrawn variant is hidden by default in the Studio sketch view and in the shot. A toggle in
  Studio (`--all` on the CLI) shows it again, labelled "withdrawn by agent: <reason>", so Tom can reopen it. Part
  of B240.

at: 12:13:42Z}` and the sketch dir is gone, so B228 is proven on the real case. B240's shot part is
behaviourally red-checked. B240 Studio toggle: where the toggle goes is a look question, so the builder sketches
it on design-parts/sketches, and Tom picks.

components/title-bar --prodct studio`. The behavioural red is quoted. Why no tool caught it: argsOf had no list
     of valid switches, so no spec could assert a refusal. Gaps, which go into B227b (decided, technical): `sketch`
lists the union of its subcommands' flags; check.ts, new-call.ts, product-command.ts, system-command.ts and
visible-change-command.ts parse argv by hand and ignore unknown flags; commit-hunks exits 1 on bad usage
instead of 2 (align it and its specs). B240 data side 0f7c28b68: hideWithdrawn defaults to false, and the view
wiring waits for Tom's pick of the control sketch.

295\. Title-bar f merge, 0c full studio check (builder, 2026-11-03, after 72ecd0adb): exit 1, 29 parts, 270
findings. components/title-bar has 0 problems and 1 warning: CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION in title-bar.ts, where
`gap-2` is glued to a `${...}`, a latent dropped class (296 corrects the effect). Why no tool
caught it: the code is only a warning, so sketch check, ready and merge let the variant through, although a
glued class in a design file is always a dropped class. Fix (B242, decided, technical): CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION
is a problem in design files and blocks ready and merge. The f defect itself is fixed in a tidy commit before
Tom's go.
20 embedding parts went stale with the merge (shell-main, flows, inbox, inventory, merge, sketches, system, ...).
"No new problem from the merge" is unproven: the pre-merge run was lost, and nothing kept a baseline. Why no
tool caught it: a merge does not name the parts it makes stale, and does not check them. Fix (B243, decided,
technical, extends B236): a merge prints the embedding parts it made stale and checks them before and after,
reporting only the new problem codes.

296\. B238 close-out + B242 (builder, 2026-11-03). B238 d154e79ce: readVitestReport/verdictOf, with the fixture
red-check.vitest-report.json captured from a real vitest run (crash only gives RED BY CRASH; crash plus
assertion stays RED). B242: a62942f0c un-glues title-bar.ts:74, 8833cb290 makes CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION a
problem (blocks sketch ready, merge and prepush, behavioural red). With the rule on, it found one more case:
canvas-frames.ts:100 `bg-et-surface-bg${extra}`, fixed in 706f18805. Now 0 in the repo. Correction to 295: no
drawing changed. Both classes are also used unglued elsewhere, so Tailwind emitted their CSS anyway, and compare
and pictures saw no difference. The defect was latent, and the only signal was a warning nothing blocked on.
Both tidy fixes change no pixel, so neither needs a sketch.

<part> --by x`now exits 2); commit-hunks exits 2 on bad usage. check.ts and the visible-change flag already
     refused. Red-check RED. Defect: B227 (2699545b4) committed 2 max-params lint errors and a guard-return-newline,
     fixed in 75a0174b1. Why no tool caught it:`yarn commit`runs the specs but not lint, and lint ran only at
     pre-push, which is 523 commits away on next. "The builder should remember" is no fix. Fix (B244, decided,
     technical):`yarn commit`runs`nx lint` on the projects of the staged files (cached, so cheap) and refuses the
commit on a lint error.

commit`derives the selection from the spec list of`yarn test:tools`: a staged file in a directory that holds
such specs runs those specs. A new directory in test:tools is then covered without another patch.

300\. B245b as built (builder, 2026-11-03). 004169aa0: `yarn commit` and the hook read the spec globs of
`test:tools` from package.json at the tested tree (toolSpecGlobsAt), and a staged file under a glob's directory
runs that directory's specs with `node --test`; tools/scripts and apps/ethlete-studio/eslint-rules are covered
now. Verified: e2e case with a `tools/lint/*.spec.mjs` glob refuses a failing change; red-check RED.
Also found: `design check` after a62942f0c carried the go of elements/shell-main and pages/inventory
(refreshedBy "design check", the decided B219/B223 carry), and the builder left that refresh uncommitted. Why
no tool caught it: check writes go.json silently and no commit gate sees an uncommitted refresh. Recommended
B246, sent to the grill session.

### Go carry decisions (2026-11-03)

- Tom: the go system is not extended any further; its rework (A10, "build-ready" replaces go and acceptance) is
  pulled forward now. So no rule on who commits a go carry, and B246 is dropped: both are go-system extensions. The
  go.json already in the tree (Tom's title-bar go plus the carries) is committed once as it is.

302\. B241 + B240 sketch + B244 at work (builder, 2026-11-03). B241 715f4857f: a Tauri command appends
`<ISO> <command> part=<p> status=<n> <message>` to /tmp/ethlete-studio-design-actions.log on every refused
design action (cargo test, 4 vitest cases, red-check RED; not yet exercised in the real app). B240 sketch
5e51db22a on pages/sketches: A an entry in the round select, B an SDK switch beside it (agent's pick), C a muted
footer row; Tom picks. go.json committed as it was in 66e71e8e3 (Tom's title-bar go plus the carries of
shell-main, inventory, system). B244 caught its first real case: HEAD carried two ethlete-studio lint errors
from 0f7c28b68 (max-params on sketchRoundsOf, click-without-key on the comment-draft div), fixed in 8bf9046ca.
Why no tool caught it then: 0f7c28b68 predates B244; the gate is the fix, no new item.

305\. B247 as built (builder, 2026-11-03, 74501d02b). INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE is a problem rule. The detector
(rules/inline-ui.ts, `inlineUiOf(source)`) reads string and template literals through the TS AST and flags
button/input/select/textarea, raw `<et-*>` tags and `et-*` attributes, and markup with an interactive role,
tabindex or data-et-action; `data-et-part` tags are skipped. It runs on page parts plus their relative/@shared
imports, and on sketch variants, so it blocks sketch ready and merge. Open list OPEN_INLINE_UI
(rules/inline-ui-in-page-open.ts): 14 entries keyed by product + place + anchor + kind, with an exact count and an
owner. An unlisted hit, a count overrun (on every hit of the group) and a stale entry (fewer hits than count) are
problems; a listed hit is a warning. Red-check: every mutation failed the spec. Renaming an anchored const gives an
unlisted problem plus a stale entry, as intended. The survey in finding 303 missed 2 more regex patches (`loading`
in merge.ts and system.ts write `<button data-loading>` into embedded markup); B248a owns them. COMPONENT-COPY gap
confirmed: it matches only component-part CSS classes, so it missed inbox.ts:309 and :316-335. Decision
(technical): the gap stays closed inside INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE (raw et- markup names the part to embed); COMPONENT-COPY
is not extended, because a second rule would report the same place twice and need its own list. B248a: the first
sub-agent ran out of context with nothing committed. A fresh one finishes it in slices, with a per-part pixel proof,
shrinking OPEN_INLINE_UI in the same commits. The extracted parts have no hover/active/focus-visible looks (the
inline originals had none either). That becomes design work for Tom as sketches, and CONTROL-PART-MISSING becomes
CONTROL-PART-INCOMPLETE.

306\. Red frames on the B240 sketch (Tom, 2026-11-03). In Studio, pages/sketches showed "Failed to fetch
dynamically imported module .../pages-sketches/a/pages/sketches/sketches.ts" in 3 states for the base, a and b,
while the badge said "Wartet auf deine Wahl". Cause (builder, not reproducible afterwards): the B248a sub-agent
edited pages/sketches files while Studio loaded those states. Vite failed one request mid-edit, and the browser
caches a failed dynamic import for the page's lifetime, so the frames stay red after the file is fixed. Why no tool
caught it: `sketch ready`/`sketch check` render every state, but on the CLI's own fresh design server, not on the
Studio dev server the user looks at. Their verdict was right; Studio never retries a failed frame and still offers
the pick. Fix (B254, decided, technical): in the sketch view, a variant with an errored frame shows no Übernehmen,
the badge says the round has a render error, and an errored frame re-imports (cache-busted) on the next
design-server change event; a sketch-view case joins the frame-load-failed e2e suite. Side facts: the B240 sketch
holds its own copies of sketches.ts and shared/sketch-status.ts with holdTrigger inline, so it is rebased onto the
B248a page before Tom's pick is merged (no picture change). The warning triangles in the part tree on inbox, merge,
sketches and system are the listed OPEN_INLINE_UI hits, but their title says "Render-Check: 1 Warnung"
(tree-row-item.component.ts:59). Fix (B255, decided, technical): the tree warning title names the rule and the
owner, so the user can tell an open-list entry from a render warning.

307\. B248a as built (builder, 2026-11-03). e7c26984e: the sdk button design mock gets `loading` (real loader
markup, spinner sized from BUTTON_SPINNER_CONFIG), red-check RED. 27804bf45: the page-local controls move into the
new parts components/comment-row, list-row, hold-trigger and comment-target (comment-target is declared a
control); the sdk switch passes options.attributes through; the merge/system `loading` regexes and the
capabilities.ts act/titled regexes are gone; all 10 B248a OPEN_INLINE_UI entries are removed in the same commit.
red-check says NOT RED (no spec changed), so the gate is the rule: INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE went from 10 listed hits to 0,
leaving the 5 B248b warnings. Pixel proof by `design shot --states` from HEAD vs tree: 0 px on inbox, sketches,
system, sdk button and sdk switch. merge differs in one band of the embedded thumbnails, but two HEAD-only runs
differ in the same band. Three new defects:
(a) Stale mocks: the design server reads the mocks from dist/libs/components/design, and the agent copied the new
button.ts there by hand. A check on a stale dist renders the old mock without a word. Why no tool caught it: nothing
compares libs/components/design with dist. Fix (B256, decided, technical): a problem, not a warning (finding 295).
`design check`, `sketch check`/`ready` and `design shot` refuse to run on a stale dist and print the build command,
and the design server shows the same refusal as a banner in Studio.
(b) Restyled embed: the sdk switch part draws an unchecked-track border that the inbox switch never had. The page
embeds the part but passes switchStyles to stay pixel-identical, so the page and the part look different. Why no tool
caught it: no rule flags an embed that overrides the embedded part's look. Fix (B257): a sketch for Tom on the sdk
switch, with and without the border; after his pick, the page drops switchStyles. Whether a style override on an
embed becomes a rule is decided after B257.
(c) Flaky picture: merge shots differ between two runs of the same files, so no pixel proof on merge can be trusted.
Fix (B258, decided, technical): find the nondeterministic source in the merge thumbnails and make it stable.
`design shot` runs each state twice and reports a part whose two runs differ as a problem.

308\. Owner of the canvas e2e red "a listing refresh re-navigates no iframe" (B232, finding 287), found by bisect
(builder, 2026-11-03). First bad commit is 030fe2f36 ("Draw the round 2 Sketches page in the sketch view"); its parent
f05409524 passes with 0 navigations. B241 is not the owner. Mechanism: the iframes are destroyed and recreated, not
re-navigated. Each refresh reads the listing twice (concat(quick, full), system-view.component.ts:511). The quick
read has no `unchanged` list, so every shot gets changed:null (system-tree.ts:1382), and an all-unchanged variant row
lands in changedRows, which renders its iframes. The full read then sets changed:false, and sameRows
(sketches.component.ts:243-250) moves the row into the collapsed "same" group, so the iframes are destroyed. This
repeats on every refresh. The sketch view shares the path, but it only flashes all-unchanged variants, so it does not
explain Tom's single slow frame (finding 306). Untested candidate for that: sketchRevisionOf
(studio-view/frame-revisions.ts:109-123) gives one revision to the whole sketch, so any redraw changes every frame's
src. Why no tool caught it: when 030fe2f36 landed, the canvas suite crashed in setup (it ran `git archive` on the
elements-shell-main sketch, which 5a29b1b94 had deleted, from 155777af9 to 8d5d281cb), and before 03d197841 e2e-check
did not count a crash before the first case as a failure. When the suite ran again, finding 287 filed the red as a
separate bug without a bisect. The STATUS B197 line "e2e-check 4221e7cb3: canvas 104/105" cannot be true, because
that revision's own suite crashes in setup, so the run used an uncommitted tree. Fix (B232, decided, technical): the
quick read's changed:null means "unknown" and keeps a row in its previous group until the full listing arrives.
Fix (B259, decided, technical): e2e-check always runs the suite from a clean worktree of the named revision, never
from the working tree, and prints the suite's own sha. A red that appears in an e2e run is bisected before it is filed
as a separate bug. Fix (B260, decided, technical): probe sketchRevisionOf. If a redraw reloads unchanged frames, the
revision becomes per frame (one picture, one revision).

309\. Tree marks (B254/B255 results, builder, 2026-11-03). B254 built in 9e7ebf434: a variant with an errored frame
offers no Übernehmen, and the badge reads "Render-Fehler in dieser Runde" (red-check RED; e2e pending under B259).
The badge reuses the neutral tonal badge, and sketch-status.ts has no such status. Its look goes to Tom as a sketch
(B261). B255 as specified was moot: the live part title already names the rule (system-tree.ts:289), and the
open-list warnings never reach the tree (list-system.ts:322 sends only ruleProblemsOf). Facts on the live server
(HEAD 855305f90): no part and no sketch carries a mark now; Tom's Studio is a dev build from 09:59, so an old
build is ruled out. The triangles Tom saw were most likely error-level INLINE-UI hits while B247 was uncommitted
and had no open list yet. Two real defects: (a) a sketch entry with a problem gets title = sketch.target
(system-tree.ts:121), so its tooltip names the target path, not the variant or the rule; (b) the listing carries
5 product-level problems that the tree never shows (SAMPLE-DEFAULT inbox.component.ts:72; UNBOUND-INPUT
system-page.component.ts commentMode, draft, send, reason), because they are not attached to the part whose file
they sit in. Why no tool caught it: nothing compares the problems in the listing with the problems the tree draws.
Fix (B255, decided, technical): a sketch entry's title lists "<variant>: <rule>: <message>" per problem; a
product-level problem attaches to the part that owns its file (one product row only when no part owns the file);
a spec asserts that every listed problem reaches some tree row.
