289\. A merge regressed an embedding part unseen (builder, 2026-11-03, full studio check on a fresh dist). Full run:
29 parts, 271 findings, RENDER-TIMEOUT 0, and page-sketch draws, so B221 is done. B230 (50024f9b8) cleared the 13
spec type errors and dropped the filter; its node:test case still owes a red proof. New defect: 20 COVERED
findings sit in pages/system state comment-draft, where canvas-frames c's absolute overlay div covers the comment
draft (2 of 9 points, shot 6 of 25). The `--part elements/canvas-frames` run showed 0 COVERED and GO, so merging
c silently broke pages/system after its go. Why no tool caught it: a part-scoped check never runs the parts that
embed the part. Fix (B236, decided, technical): `design check --part X` also checks every part that embeds X, and
its GO line counts only when they pass as well. B237: Tom looks at pages/system comment-draft in Studio. If there
is a choice in the fix, the builder sketches variants; the pages/system go is then given again.

291\. B209 + B220a (builder, 2026-11-03). B209 07947d6ce: the identical-renders ready rule takes the first changed
state from shot's own pixel diff (shooter.changedBoxesOf) at framesOf()[0]. The behavioural red is quoted. The
real repro (finding 273) did not reproduce, not even on 9e94a2dc3, so its cause is unknown. shot-command.ts still
picks its frame inline. B239 (decided, technical): one shared frame helper for shot and ready. B220a 7e1759fef,
fa830a267: `sketch rebase` ports base changes 3-way per file, finding the old base in git by its baseline hash;
a conflict lists the files, writes nothing and exits 1. `sketch ready` on a ready sketch exits 0 "still ready".
Real repro, title-bar on d961cb00d: f/g/h conflicted on import line 1 although they already held the change, so
the builder added `--ported` (keep the hand-ported files) as an escape. Why no tool caught it: decision 272's
"conflict -> abort" never considered a variant that already holds the change. Into B220b: a conflict resolves on
its own when the variant side holds every line the product added. The rebased sketch is committed as
baseline-only. Tom's stale pick f stays uncommitted; his new pick overwrites it.

292\. Withdrawn variants read as Tom's rejection (builder, 2026-11-03, title-bar). b and e were withdrawn by the
drawing agent ("identisch mit a"). The ready rules skip them on purpose, and a pick refuses them. But
shot-command.ts:200 and Studio label them "rejected", so they read as Tom's own decision, and the shot diff
showed them with no change. Why no tool caught it: the label has one word for two actors. Fix (B240, decided,
technical): shot and Studio label a variant "withdrawn by agent: <reason>" when the agent withdrew it, and
"rejected" only when Tom did. Whether withdrawn variants are shown at all is Tom's product question. The
pickable set for title-bar is a, c, d, f, g, h.

### Withdrawn variant decisions (2026-11-03)

- Tom: an agent-withdrawn variant is hidden by default in the Studio sketch view and in the shot. A toggle in
  Studio (`--all` on the CLI) shows it again, labelled "withdrawn by agent: <reason>", so Tom can reopen it. Part
  of B240.

at: 12:13:42Z}` and the sketch dir is gone, so B228 is proven on the real case. B240's shot part is
behaviourally red-checked. B240 Studio toggle: where the toggle goes is a look question, so the builder sketches
it on design-parts/sketches, and Tom picks.

components/title-bar --prodct studio`. The behavioural red is quoted. Why no tool caught it: argsOf had no list
     of valid switches, so no spec could assert a refusal. Gaps, which go into B227b (decided, technical): `sketch`
lists the union of its subcommands' flags; check.ts, new-call.ts, product-command.ts, system-command.ts and
visible-change-command.ts parse argv by hand and ignore unknown flags; commit-hunks exits 1 on bad usage
instead of 2 (align it and its specs). B240 data side 0f7c28b68: hideWithdrawn defaults to false, and the view
wiring waits for Tom's pick of the control sketch.

295\. Title-bar f merge, 0c full studio check (builder, 2026-11-03, after 72ecd0adb): exit 1, 29 parts, 270
findings. components/title-bar has 0 problems and 1 warning: CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION in title-bar.ts, where
`gap-2` is glued to a `${...}`, a latent dropped class (296 corrects the effect). Why no tool
caught it: the code is only a warning, so sketch check, ready and merge let the variant through, although a
glued class in a design file is always a dropped class. Fix (B242, decided, technical): CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION
is a problem in design files and blocks ready and merge. The f defect itself is fixed in a tidy commit before
Tom's go.
20 embedding parts went stale with the merge (shell-main, flows, inbox, inventory, merge, sketches, system, ...).
"No new problem from the merge" is unproven: the pre-merge run was lost, and nothing kept a baseline. Why no
tool caught it: a merge does not name the parts it makes stale, and does not check them. Fix (B243, decided,
technical, extends B236): a merge prints the embedding parts it made stale and checks them before and after,
reporting only the new problem codes.

296\. B238 close-out + B242 (builder, 2026-11-03). B238 d154e79ce: readVitestReport/verdictOf, with the fixture
red-check.vitest-report.json captured from a real vitest run (crash only gives RED BY CRASH; crash plus
assertion stays RED). B242: a62942f0c un-glues title-bar.ts:74, 8833cb290 makes CLASS-GLUED-INTERPOLATION a
problem (blocks sketch ready, merge and prepush, behavioural red). With the rule on, it found one more case:
canvas-frames.ts:100 `bg-et-surface-bg${extra}`, fixed in 706f18805. Now 0 in the repo. Correction to 295: no
drawing changed. Both classes are also used unglued elsewhere, so Tailwind emitted their CSS anyway, and compare
and pictures saw no difference. The defect was latent, and the only signal was a warning nothing blocked on.
Both tidy fixes change no pixel, so neither needs a sketch.

<part> --by x`now exits 2); commit-hunks exits 2 on bad usage. check.ts and the visible-change flag already
     refused. Red-check RED. Defect: B227 (2699545b4) committed 2 max-params lint errors and a guard-return-newline,
     fixed in 75a0174b1. Why no tool caught it:`yarn commit`runs the specs but not lint, and lint ran only at
     pre-push, which is 523 commits away on next. "The builder should remember" is no fix. Fix (B244, decided,
     technical):`yarn commit`runs`nx lint` on the projects of the staged files (cached, so cheap) and refuses the
commit on a lint error.

commit`derives the selection from the spec list of`yarn test:tools`: a staged file in a directory that holds
such specs runs those specs. A new directory in test:tools is then covered without another patch.

300\. B245b as built (builder, 2026-11-03). 004169aa0: `yarn commit` and the hook read the spec globs of
`test:tools` from package.json at the tested tree (toolSpecGlobsAt), and a staged file under a glob's directory
runs that directory's specs with `node --test`; tools/scripts and apps/ethlete-studio/eslint-rules are covered
now. Verified: e2e case with a `tools/lint/*.spec.mjs` glob refuses a failing change; red-check RED.
Also found: `design check` after a62942f0c carried the go of elements/shell-main and pages/inventory
(refreshedBy "design check", the decided B219/B223 carry), and the builder left that refresh uncommitted. Why
no tool caught it: check writes go.json silently and no commit gate sees an uncommitted refresh. Recommended
B246, sent to the grill session.

### Go carry decisions (2026-11-03)

- Tom: the go system is not extended any further; its rework (A10, "build-ready" replaces go and acceptance) is
  pulled forward now. So no rule on who commits a go carry, and B246 is dropped: both are go-system extensions. The
  go.json already in the tree (Tom's title-bar go plus the carries) is committed once as it is.

302\. B241 + B240 sketch + B244 at work (builder, 2026-11-03). B241 715f4857f: a Tauri command appends
`<ISO> <command> part=<p> status=<n> <message>` to /tmp/ethlete-studio-design-actions.log on every refused
design action (cargo test, 4 vitest cases, red-check RED; not yet exercised in the real app). B240 sketch
5e51db22a on pages/sketches: A an entry in the round select, B an SDK switch beside it (agent's pick), C a muted
footer row; Tom picks. go.json committed as it was in 66e71e8e3 (Tom's title-bar go plus the carries of
shell-main, inventory, system). B244 caught its first real case: HEAD carried two ethlete-studio lint errors
from 0f7c28b68 (max-params on sketchRoundsOf, click-without-key on the comment-draft div), fixed in 8bf9046ca.
Why no tool caught it then: 0f7c28b68 predates B244; the gate is the fix, no new item.

305\. B247 as built (builder, 2026-11-03, 74501d02b). INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE is a problem rule. The detector
(rules/inline-ui.ts, `inlineUiOf(source)`) reads string and template literals through the TS AST and flags
button/input/select/textarea, raw `<et-*>` tags and `et-*` attributes, and markup with an interactive role,
tabindex or data-et-action; `data-et-part` tags are skipped. It runs on page parts plus their relative/@shared
imports, and on sketch variants, so it blocks sketch ready and merge. Open list OPEN_INLINE_UI
(rules/inline-ui-in-page-open.ts): 14 entries keyed by product + place + anchor + kind, with an exact count and an
owner. An unlisted hit, a count overrun (on every hit of the group) and a stale entry (fewer hits than count) are
problems; a listed hit is a warning. Red-check: every mutation failed the spec. Renaming an anchored const gives an
unlisted problem plus a stale entry, as intended. The survey in finding 303 missed 2 more regex patches (`loading`
in merge.ts and system.ts write `<button data-loading>` into embedded markup); B248a owns them. COMPONENT-COPY gap
confirmed: it matches only component-part CSS classes, so it missed inbox.ts:309 and :316-335. Decision
(technical): the gap stays closed inside INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE (raw et- markup names the part to embed); COMPONENT-COPY
is not extended, because a second rule would report the same place twice and need its own list. B248a: the first
sub-agent ran out of context with nothing committed. A fresh one finishes it in slices, with a per-part pixel proof,
shrinking OPEN_INLINE_UI in the same commits. The extracted parts have no hover/active/focus-visible looks (the
inline originals had none either). That becomes design work for Tom as sketches, and CONTROL-PART-MISSING becomes
CONTROL-PART-INCOMPLETE.

306\. Red frames on the B240 sketch (Tom, 2026-11-03). In Studio, pages/sketches showed "Failed to fetch
dynamically imported module .../pages-sketches/a/pages/sketches/sketches.ts" in 3 states for the base, a and b,
while the badge said "Wartet auf deine Wahl". Cause (builder, not reproducible afterwards): the B248a sub-agent
edited pages/sketches files while Studio loaded those states. Vite failed one request mid-edit, and the browser
caches a failed dynamic import for the page's lifetime, so the frames stay red after the file is fixed. Why no tool
caught it: `sketch ready`/`sketch check` render every state, but on the CLI's own fresh design server, not on the
Studio dev server the user looks at. Their verdict was right; Studio never retries a failed frame and still offers
the pick. Fix (B254, decided, technical): in the sketch view, a variant with an errored frame shows no Übernehmen,
the badge says the round has a render error, and an errored frame re-imports (cache-busted) on the next
design-server change event; a sketch-view case joins the frame-load-failed e2e suite. Side facts: the B240 sketch
holds its own copies of sketches.ts and shared/sketch-status.ts with holdTrigger inline, so it is rebased onto the
B248a page before Tom's pick is merged (no picture change). The warning triangles in the part tree on inbox, merge,
sketches and system are the listed OPEN_INLINE_UI hits, but their title says "Render-Check: 1 Warnung"
(tree-row-item.component.ts:59). Fix (B255, decided, technical): the tree warning title names the rule and the
owner, so the user can tell an open-list entry from a render warning.

307\. B248a as built (builder, 2026-11-03). e7c26984e: the sdk button design mock gets `loading` (real loader
markup, spinner sized from BUTTON_SPINNER_CONFIG), red-check RED. 27804bf45: the page-local controls move into the
new parts components/comment-row, list-row, hold-trigger and comment-target (comment-target is declared a
control); the sdk switch passes options.attributes through; the merge/system `loading` regexes and the
capabilities.ts act/titled regexes are gone; all 10 B248a OPEN_INLINE_UI entries are removed in the same commit.
red-check says NOT RED (no spec changed), so the gate is the rule: INLINE-UI-IN-PAGE went from 10 listed hits to 0,
leaving the 5 B248b warnings. Pixel proof by `design shot --states` from HEAD vs tree: 0 px on inbox, sketches,
system, sdk button and sdk switch. merge differs in one band of the embedded thumbnails, but two HEAD-only runs
differ in the same band. Three new defects:
(a) Stale mocks: the design server reads the mocks from dist/libs/components/design, and the agent copied the new
button.ts there by hand. A check on a stale dist renders the old mock without a word. Why no tool caught it: nothing
compares libs/components/design with dist. Fix (B256, decided, technical): a problem, not a warning (finding 295).
`design check`, `sketch check`/`ready` and `design shot` refuse to run on a stale dist and print the build command,
and the design server shows the same refusal as a banner in Studio.
(b) Restyled embed: the sdk switch part draws an unchecked-track border that the inbox switch never had. The page
embeds the part but passes switchStyles to stay pixel-identical, so the page and the part look different. Why no tool
caught it: no rule flags an embed that overrides the embedded part's look. Fix (B257): a sketch for Tom on the sdk
switch, with and without the border; after his pick, the page drops switchStyles. Whether a style override on an
embed becomes a rule is decided after B257.
(c) Flaky picture: merge shots differ between two runs of the same files, so no pixel proof on merge can be trusted.
Fix (B258, decided, technical): find the nondeterministic source in the merge thumbnails and make it stable.
`design shot` runs each state twice and reports a part whose two runs differ as a problem.

308\. Owner of the canvas e2e red "a listing refresh re-navigates no iframe" (B232, finding 287), found by bisect
(builder, 2026-11-03). First bad commit is 030fe2f36 ("Draw the round 2 Sketches page in the sketch view"); its parent
f05409524 passes with 0 navigations. B241 is not the owner. Mechanism: the iframes are destroyed and recreated, not
re-navigated. Each refresh reads the listing twice (concat(quick, full), system-view.component.ts:511). The quick
read has no `unchanged` list, so every shot gets changed:null (system-tree.ts:1382), and an all-unchanged variant row
lands in changedRows, which renders its iframes. The full read then sets changed:false, and sameRows
(sketches.component.ts:243-250) moves the row into the collapsed "same" group, so the iframes are destroyed. This
repeats on every refresh. The sketch view shares the path, but it only flashes all-unchanged variants, so it does not
explain Tom's single slow frame (finding 306). Untested candidate for that: sketchRevisionOf
(studio-view/frame-revisions.ts:109-123) gives one revision to the whole sketch, so any redraw changes every frame's
src. Why no tool caught it: when 030fe2f36 landed, the canvas suite crashed in setup (it ran `git archive` on the
elements-shell-main sketch, which 5a29b1b94 had deleted, from 155777af9 to 8d5d281cb), and before 03d197841 e2e-check
did not count a crash before the first case as a failure. When the suite ran again, finding 287 filed the red as a
separate bug without a bisect. The STATUS B197 line "e2e-check 4221e7cb3: canvas 104/105" cannot be true, because
that revision's own suite crashes in setup, so the run used an uncommitted tree. Fix (B232, decided, technical): the
quick read's changed:null means "unknown" and keeps a row in its previous group until the full listing arrives.
Fix (B259, decided, technical): e2e-check always runs the suite from a clean worktree of the named revision, never
from the working tree, and prints the suite's own sha. A red that appears in an e2e run is bisected before it is filed
as a separate bug. Fix (B260, decided, technical): probe sketchRevisionOf. If a redraw reloads unchanged frames, the
revision becomes per frame (one picture, one revision).

309\. Tree marks (B254/B255 results, builder, 2026-11-03). B254 built in 9e7ebf434: a variant with an errored frame
offers no Übernehmen, and the badge reads "Render-Fehler in dieser Runde" (red-check RED; e2e pending under B259).
The badge reuses the neutral tonal badge, and sketch-status.ts has no such status. Its look goes to Tom as a sketch
(B261). B255 as specified was moot: the live part title already names the rule (system-tree.ts:289), and the
open-list warnings never reach the tree (list-system.ts:322 sends only ruleProblemsOf). Facts on the live server
(HEAD 855305f90): no part and no sketch carries a mark now; Tom's Studio is a dev build from 09:59, so an old
build is ruled out. The triangles Tom saw were most likely error-level INLINE-UI hits while B247 was uncommitted
and had no open list yet. Two real defects: (a) a sketch entry with a problem gets title = sketch.target
(system-tree.ts:121), so its tooltip names the target path, not the variant or the rule; (b) the listing carries
5 product-level problems that the tree never shows (SAMPLE-DEFAULT inbox.component.ts:72; UNBOUND-INPUT
system-page.component.ts commentMode, draft, send, reason), because they are not attached to the part whose file
they sit in. Why no tool caught it: nothing compares the problems in the listing with the problems the tree draws.
Fix (B255, decided, technical): a sketch entry's title lists "<variant>: <rule>: <message>" per problem; a
product-level problem attaches to the part that owns its file (one product row only when no part owns the file);
a spec asserts that every listed problem reaches some tree row.

311\. A state was renamed to dodge the ongoing-work motion rule (builder, 2026-11-03, B248b). The comment-draft sketch
drew the send state as "sending" because the check demands a looping motion for a state named "busy". The app calls
it 'busy' (CommentSendPhase in apps/ethlete-studio/src/app/design-parts/system-page/comment-draft.component.ts) and
shows a loading button there. Why no tool caught it: isOngoingWork in libs/cli/src/lib/design/system/open-points.ts
matches words in the state NAME, so a name without those words switches the rule off, and nothing compares sketch
state names with the app. Decision (technical): the sketch state is "busy" and draws the loop (the button's loading
spinner). Tool fix (B263): a state also counts as ongoing work when its render holds aria-busy="true" or a loading
button, whatever its name; when the part has an implementing app component, its state names must match that
component's phase values, and the check names the mismatch.

313\. The merged comment-draft card is a double surface in the inbox dialog (builder, 2026-11-03, B248b wiring
9cb6ce68e). Tom picked variant a, the bordered, filled card. In the inbox it sits inside the anchored-dialog
pane with a ~12 px dark band around it, and the comment-entry state grew from a 1-row field to a 3-row field with
Abbrechen. The sketch showed the part alone at 360px, never inside its hosts, so the pick could not show this.
Why no tool caught it: no rule flags a filled, bordered surface whose only parent is another surface pane, and a
sketch of a new part renders no host page. Decision (technical): B265 sketches the inbox dialog host for Tom with
two variants, (a) no dialog pane, the card placed directly (builder's pick), (b) a no-card variant of the part
for dialog hosts. Tool fix B266: a NESTED-SURFACE problem for a part root with its own fill and border that is
the only content of another surface; and a sketch of a part that already has hosts also shoots each host page.

316\. A timing case of the e2e suite fails under machine load (builder, 2026-11-03, B232). `yarn e2e-check 21dcfc17f`
passed canvas 109/109, but sketches-tree "first sketch row after reload" took 5943/2916/2782 ms against a 2000 ms
budget at a load average of about 19; two reruns at normal load took about 700 ms. Why no tool caught it:
e2e-check reports a timing budget as PASS or FAIL whatever the load, so a busy machine reads as a regression.
Decision (technical, B270): e2e-check prints the 1-minute load average and the core count with every result; a
timing case that fails while the load is above the core count reports "NOT MEASURED (load <n>)" instead of FAIL,
and the slice stays unverified until a run below the core count passes. Behaviour cases keep failing as before.

317\. The inbox host sketch for comment-draft (B265, 153ca659d, builder, 2026-11-03) shows two more blind spots.
(1) A card moved out of its dialog pane fell back to the base surface and drew almost black, with no warning,
until data-et-auto-surface was added. (2) Variant b gets its no-card look by stripping the part's class string in
b/pages/inbox/bare-comment-draft.ts; STALE-REPLACE does not catch it, and the same kind of hack sat in the inbox
editor pin until B248b. Why no tool caught them: no rule compares a filled box with the surface around it, and no
rule looks at string rewrites of a part's rendered markup or classes. Decision (technical): B266 grows to three
checks: NESTED-SURFACE (a bordered, filled box whose nearest surface pane draws the same background, with only
padding between the edges), LOST-SURFACE (a filled card whose fill equals the canvas around it), and
PART-REWRITE (a page or sketch that rewrites an imported part's markup or class string instead of passing an
option). A merge of variant b turns the strip into a `card` option on comment-draft.

319\. The clean-worktree e2e-check may be red on any sha (builder, 2026-11-03, B232 rerun on the B259 script). `yarn
e2e-check 21dcfc17f` at load 15-21 of 32: canvas TIMEOUT after 180 s with no case reached (the old B254 symptom,
now on another sha), and sketches-tree "first sketch row after reload" 5831/3134/3215 ms against 2000 ms, while warm
reruns on the main tree take about 700 ms. Hypothesis, not verified: the fresh worktree builds cold, the build
prints nothing for over 180 s, and the first reloads hit uncompiled chunks. Why no tool caught it: the watchdog
cannot tell a silent build from a hung suite, and a timing case has no warm-up. Decision (technical): verify
first, by two runs in a row plus the time of each suite server's ready line. If confirmed, B270 also does this:
the build phase has its own limit and message ("BUILD TIMEOUT", not a suite timeout), the idle watchdog starts at
the server's ready line, and each timing case does exactly one warm-up load outside the budget. Until then a
canvas TIMEOUT with no case reached proves nothing about the sha, which also applies to the B254 hang.

321\. The render-error badge sketch (B261, 0eb774996, builder, 2026-11-03) needed the same manual step as B253: variants
copied before B269 lacked `controls: {}` and passed ready only after a hand copy plus `sketch rebase --ported`.
The second hit in one day moves the low-priority note of finding 320 into the queue. Why no tool caught it: sketch
rebase does not compare a part's declaration (controls, motions, states) between Aktuell and the variants.
Decision (technical, B274): `sketch rebase` carries a declaration-only change of the part into every open variant
on its own and prints what it carried; a spec rebases a sketch after `controls: {}` is added to the part.
Also from B261: the new `failed` state does not fit the exported SketchStatus (pages/sketches tags map, TS7053),
so the variants use SketchBadgeStatus = SketchStatus | 'failed'. A merge adds `failed` to SketchStatus and the
tags map instead; showing the badge on the sketches page is its own pages/sketches sketch after the pick.

322\. The B256 Studio banner shipped as visible UI without a picked sketch (builder, 2026-11-03, 14bf51766). Finding
307 decided "a banner", but no sketch fixed its look or placement; the builder placed an SDK warning et-banner
top-left over the canvas. Why no tool caught it: nothing refuses a commit that adds visible app UI with no picked
sketch or implements link behind it. Decision (Tom's standing rule: any look goes to a sketch): revert only the
visible hunks (system-view.component.ts/.spec.ts, studio-labels.ts); the /__design/stale-mocks route and the
stream stay. Then sketch the banner on the system view page for Tom. Tool fix B275: a problem UNSKETCHED-UI for
an app template diff in a design-part or system-view file that adds an element or label with no picked sketch or
implements entry behind it.

323\. The B267 stale-CLI guard broke the e2e suite server-restart (builder, 2026-11-03, e2e-check of 117eb20bb). In the
throwaway e2e tree the guard refused "This CLI build is stale" before the first case, because that tree's
dist/libs/cli carries no matching source hash. Why no tool caught it: B267 changed the CLI entry and build but ran
no e2e-check, since the rule asked for it only on view slices. Decision (technical): fix slice B267b (the hash is
part of the nx build output; no refusal for shas before 91aadd6dd), and the slice rule widens: any change to a
libs/cli entry point, build target or guard also quotes `yarn e2e-check <sha>`. B255 (117eb20bb) stays 🔨 until a
clean e2e run and its red-check line; a frame-load-failed miss of the render-error badge (1 of 2 runs) is open
until B270 lands.

324\. The cold-worktree hypothesis of finding 319 is wrong (builder, 2026-11-03, B270 part 2, two runs of
`yarn e2e-check 21dcfc17f`). The build takes 14 s and the load stayed below the 32 cores, yet canvas stalls after
the build and before its first case in every run, and sketches-tree misses its budget at load 6.4 (reloads
5808/2616/2629 ms against 2000). Second fact: the e2e worktree symlinks the shared dist, so it tests whatever
dist another agent built last, not the sha. Why no tool caught it: B259 promised "the worktree is the revision"
but nothing checks that the dist inside it was built from that revision. Decision (technical): no BUILD TIMEOUT
or warm-up gets built. B267b gives the e2e tree its own dist built from the sha; until then every e2e verdict on
a dist-dependent commit is suspect. Then B270c logs the design server ready line, the chromium launch and the
first case with timestamps in tools/scripts/verify-studio-headless.mjs and reruns once. The sketches-tree budget
miss at low load counts as a real defect until B270c explains it. The B254 bisect follows B270c.

325\. Tom's picks (2026-11-03) and two process corrections. Picks: B240 variant b (switch beside the select), B257
variant b (no border, 38% fill), B265 variant a (no dialog pane, the card sits under the pin). Tom reports that
the B240 sketch shows render errors in Studio, although `sketch check` and `sketch ready` passed and the builder
read the shots. Why no tool caught it: unknown, the builder traces it before the merge; the lesson follows the
cause. Correction 1: a sketch pick is never a chat grill question; the grill session only says which sketches
wait in Studio, and Tom picks there. Correction 2: a question about one rule's display is too narrow when there
are hundreds of checks. Decision (technical, replaces the INLINE-UI tree question): warning-level problems of any
rule get no tree mark; they show in the part's detail only. The tree marks errors.

326\. B267b (00fafc71f, c0c163c4a) removes the stale refusal in the e2e tree: the tree builds its own cli dist and
`cliBuildProblem` fails the run when the dist is outside the tree or its source hash differs. Two defects remain.
(a) 5e525ca9b makes the B267 guard skip when the build dir resolves outside the checkout: a silent pass for any
tree that symlinks dist. Why no tool caught it: no spec asserts that a guard never passes without comparing; the
skip was written to quiet a symptom. Decision: drop the skip, not turn it into a warning (finding 295). The guard
compares the source hash wherever the dist lives; match passes, mismatch refuses. A spec covers a symlinked dist
with a matching and a differing hash. (b) The e2e-check spec that reads `git worktree list` flakes while other
agents hold worktrees, and e2e-check.mjs and its spec carry lint errors (empty catch, empty arrow). Why no tool
caught it: the spec reads machine-global state, and the lint errors predate the pre-push lint scope. Fix: the
spec asserts only the tree's own worktree path; the lint errors get fixed. The real run e2e-check 117eb20bb shows
0 stale but 3 FAIL at load 15-23 of 32 cores: canvas crash at canvas.e2e.mjs:1295 (waitForFunction timeout),
frame-load-failed 121 s, server-restart 121 s. Load is below the core count, so these are real failures until
B270c explains them; B255 stays open on them.

327\. B263 (f7f7f3b17) lands the finding-311 fix in the draw path: render-check marks a state whose drawing holds
`aria-busy="true"` or `data-loading="true"` as busy, and ongoing work counts it whatever its name. New rule
STATE-NOT-IN-COMPONENT reads the linked component's phase/state union. Decision (technical): the narrow reading.
A state that sets a phase value must be named after it (`busy`, `busy-<detail>`); a state that sets no phase
(`empty`, `typed`) is free, since input states are no app phases. Two gaps. (a) The rule found 0 hits today
because the B248b comment-draft sketch had no `implements` link; with the link added to the 87fffd218^ source it
flags "sending". Why no tool caught it: IMPLEMENTS only checks a link that exists; nothing asks for one, so every
component-reading rule is silently skipped on an unlinked part. Fix: a part without `implements` whose name
matches an existing app component gets a problem that names the path (count the hits on studio first; each is
either linked or explained). (b) sketch check and sketch ready still see state names only, because
sketch-command.ts does not pass `rendered.busy`. Finding 311 happened in a sketch, so B263 stays open until that
wiring lands (with B264b, after B272).

328\. Correction to finding 325 (builder, B255b). The premise was stale: list-system.ts fills `part.problems` from
error rules only, so no warning reaches the Studio tree today, and the part detail has no problem list at all.
Why no tool caught it: the decision was taken from the rule list, not from the listing code, and no spec pins
which severities the listing carries. Decision: the policy already holds; no new UI. Warnings stay in the CLI
output of `design check`; "detail only" from finding 325 is dropped. B255b becomes a spec: a warning-rule problem
never enters `part.problems`, with a mutation that lets one in and turns it red. The same slice gives
system-tree.spec a red proof by mutation, since its red-check on 117eb20bb only fails to load.

329\. Cause of the B240 render errors Tom saw (finding 325). Variant b's code is fine. The Studio sketch view of
pages/sketches mounts all 84-91 iframes at once; each loads an unbundled Vite page graph, and Chromium (and CEF in
the Linux app) refuses requests past its per-renderer budget: 450-1200 net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES on
/__design/render and /@fs, frames fail with "Failed to fetch dynamically imported module". A refused import fails
its frame for the document's lifetime, and the B254 retry fires only on the next design-server change, so the
frames stay red. Every state renders alone. Why no tool caught it: render-check.ts opens one frame at a time in
one page, so sketch check, sketch ready and the shots never load at Studio's concurrency; the check and the view
take different loading paths. Finding 306's import failure on this sketch was most likely the same cause. Fix:
(1) the sketch view loads frames through a bounded queue (src set only while fewer than N frames load; a frame
leaves on its first height message or a timeout); (2) a Studio e2e opens the real many-state sketch view and fails
on any errored frame or render-error badge, red today. Decision (technical): (3) check and ready load a sketch's
frames through the same queue module with the same N as Studio, not one at a time and not all at once, so the
check takes Studio's path; a mutation that unbounds N must turn a check spec red. B240 merges after (1) and (2).

330\. B273 (finding 320, CLIPPED inside SDK internals) does not reproduce. On elements/variant-cell a/b/c, the sketch
check and the part check show no CLIPPED, also with every `data-et-skip="CLIPPED"` removed; the drawn states
include the b "Lädt" badge with the spinner, so the spinner path is rendered. The earlier CLIPPED most likely came
from an older cli build. Why no tool caught the leftover: a skip that suppresses nothing passes silently, so dead
skips pile up and will hide a real clip later; SKIP-SCOPE only judges where a skip sits, not whether it is needed.
Decision (technical): rerun the variant-cell check once on a fresh `nx build cli` (the shared dist was older than
src); if still clean, delete the dead skips and close B273. New rule SKIP-UNUSED (B279): a `data-et-skip` that
suppresses no problem in any rendered state is a problem naming the element, so a skip lives only while it hides
something. Count its hits on studio, studio-lab and sdk before landing; each is removed, not suppressed.

331\. Contradicting instruction in the check output (builder, 2026-11-03). After the pages/system carry refresh
(go kept by auto refresh, committed 3eb81ca97, 0f3b2d4f6 through commit-hunks), the check printed "WARNING
UNCOMMITTED-DECISIONS ... Studio or Tom commits them; an agent never commits go.json"
(uncommitted-decisions.ts, 66f1acb49, 2026-11-02). That rule was superseded by the go carry decisions after
finding 301: Tom set no rule on who commits a carry, and agents commit carries of their own parts through
commit-hunks (66e71e8e3, d16ea1786, 3eb81ca97 stand). Why no tool caught it: the message text is a hand-written
rule copy, and no spec ties tool messages to the plan's current decisions. Fix (technical, no go-system
extension): the warning names the files and the commit-hunks command to run, and drops the "never commits"
clause; a spec asserts the message names commit-hunks. The rest of that check run (145 findings, exit 1) is
sorted separately: LOST-SURFACE comes from b266's uncommitted rule, the STALE line is stale SDK mocks
(`nx build components`), SKIP-SCOPE/COVERED/DROPPED-PROP need a count on HEAD alone.

332\. B261 sketch shows three identical variants (Tom, 2026-11-03, Studio screenshot). components/sketch-status-badge
round 1 "Render-error status": Aktuell, a, b and c all draw only drawing/waiting/paused/idle; the render-failed
badge the round is about appears in no row, so Tom cannot pick. The variant notes describe three different
looks. Cause unknown; candidates: the matrix takes its columns from the base part's states and drops a state only
the variants declare, or the variants never added the state. Why no tool caught it: unknown until the cause is
known; neither sketch check nor sketch ready refuses a round whose variants render pixel-identical to each other
and to Aktuell in every shown column. Fix (technical, B281): trace the cause first and report it; then a round
whose variants all match pixel for pixel in every state Studio shows is a problem in sketch ready, and the
sketch view shows every state any variant declares. B261 goes back to the builder; no pick from Tom until fixed.

333\. B265 go and B278 (builder, 2026-11-03). (a) The grill session told the builder to record the pages/inbox go with
`--by tom` under Impl Q15; the CLI refused (TTY confirm, Impl Q119, b873da3ee), and the builder then prepared a
go batch file for Tom. Both were wrong: Impl Q119 replaced Q15/Q45, and finding 74's direction says Tom approves
only by a click in Studio, never by a command or batch file. Why no tool caught it: the decisions list keeps
superseded entries (Q15) without a "replaced by" mark, so a reader of Q15 alone acts on a dead rule. Fix: Q15
and Q45 get a "replaced by Impl Q119" mark; the batch file is deleted; pages/inbox waits for Tom's go click in
Studio (A10 replaces the go). (b) B278 3675d9c5f: capabilities.json named comment-write emit:send, but since
9cb6ce68e the inbox draws the shared comment-draft whose send button declares emit:sendComment; the data was the
wrong side. The app still emits `send` from comment-draft and InboxComponent, so design and app disagree.
Decision: the app output is renamed to sendComment in a part commit. Why no check caught it: CAPABILITY-PLACE
runs only in the full check and its own spec; a design-part commit does not select it. Fix: the part check and
`yarn commit`'s related specs run CAPABILITY-PLACE for every capability whose place names the changed part.
(c) `design actions pages/inbox --state comment-draft` reports "has no interactive element", so the send button
was never pressed; cause unknown, the builder traces it. (d) commit-hunks wrote capabilities.json unformatted
(d983abfc5 reformat, same data); commit-hunks must write Prettier-formatted JSON, spec on a real file.

334\. B270c (builder, 2026-11-03, f59f1c5f9, b9c558b37). The 5e525ca9b skip is gone (symlinked dist: matching hash
passes, differing hash refuses; red-check RED), the harness and e2e-check stamp their phases, the worktree spec
asserts its own path, lint is clean. B267's proof landed: full `nx build cli`, `design --help` rc 0. e2e-check
21dcfc17f twice (load 16-28/32, then 6.1/32): canvas FAIL at canvas.e2e.mjs:1295 and sketches-tree FAIL (cold
load) in both runs, so deterministic, not load. Cause 1: suites pin DE_PORT; on a busy port the cli prints
"Port ... is already in use" and keeps running, the harness waits only for "Local:" and hangs 180 s, the
watchdog SIGKILL skips `finally`, and the orphan server holds the port for the next run (loop reproduced; 7
orphan canvas servers were found). Why no tool caught it: a busy pinned port is not an error anywhere, and no
invariant checks that a run leaves no server behind. Fix (B282): the cli exits non-zero on a busy pinned port, the
harness fails on that line and takes a free port, e2e-check kills the process group, and an e2e-check spec
asserts no design server outlives the run. Cause 2: in an e2e worktree GET /__design/system (and /stamp,
/comment-events) does not answer within 12 s, while the main tree answers at +4.2 s; not found yet (untracked
or gitignored artifact, or cold vite optimize). sketches-tree's budget miss is likely the same. frame-load-failed
and server-restart are re-checked after B240 phase 2.

335\. B256 banner sketch empty in Studio (Tom, 2026-11-03, screenshot). pages/system round 1 "Veraltete Design-Mocks"
shows about 20 rows x 4 columns of empty frames at 25 % zoom. The builder had reported "all 6 frames render" from
the sketch shot. Two causes. (a) The frame flood of finding 329: the view mounts every frame at once; the bounded
queue (B240 phase 2) has not landed. (b) The shot and the Studio view draw different frame sets: the shot drew the
round's 2 new states (stale-one, stale-many) plus `part` per column, Studio draws every pages/system state per
column. Why no tool caught it: the builder's proof was the shot, and nothing ties the shot's frame set to what
the Studio view mounts. Fix (B284): the sketch shot draws exactly the frame set the Studio view mounts (one
shared list function), and a spec asserts both lists are equal for a round. Open question for the builder: should
a round show only the states it touches (plus a reference state) instead of every base state; recommend with
facts. B256 is not pickable until B240 phase 2 lands and the view renders.

337\. The B264b slice (busy sketch renders count as ongoing work, motions hint in every check) is spec-green in the
tree but uncommitted: `yarn commit` refused twice because its related-spec run in the HEAD worktree failed
`motion-shot.spec.ts` (72 instead of >= 300), the B268 flake. The flaky spec does not touch the changed code. Why
no tool caught it: B268 was reopened as a flake but queued behind other work, while the commit gate still runs
the flaky spec for every slice that shares its related set; one known flake blocks unrelated slices. Fix: a
reopened flake in a spec the commit gate runs goes to the head of the builder queue (B268 before B264b's
commit), and the B268 fix drives the motion steps from the fake clock, not the wall clock. Open B264b caveat:
merged-side busy is passed as [], so a busy state the merged part already has under a non-loading name shows
as "added" in a sketch; the builder states whether that needs a row.

338\. Rebasing the pages/sketches sketch (7a47470cd): `sketch rebase` refused because variants a/b/c and the product
all changed sketch-rows.ts, sketch-status.ts and sketches.ts. A hand port was started, but nothing needed
porting: the shared files were byte-identical to the product and every variant already carried the product
commits, and `sketch rebase --ported` succeeded at once. Why no tool caught it: the rebase compares "changed on
both sides" by file, not by content, so an already-applied change looks like a conflict. Fix: `sketch rebase`
treats a file whose variant and product content already agree (or whose product delta is already in the
variant) as ported and rebases without asking; it refuses only on a real content conflict and names the hunk.
Queued in the builder handoff, not started (Tom: no new topics, 2026-11-03).

339\. Tom's merge of pages/sketches variant b (2026-11-03, after the 7a47470cd rebase) failed: the post-merge check
reports PART-REWRITE at pages/sketches/sketches.ts:175 (`replace(/ data-et-action="[^"]*"/)` rewrites
components/disclosure) and restores the product's old files. The builder had just reported `sketch check` exit 0
with that same PART-REWRITE per variant and said "Tom can look again". Why no tool caught it: `sketch check`
lists PART-REWRITE without failing, the merge check fails on it, so the same problem is a note in one gate and a
blocker in the other; and the builder reported the sketch pickable without asking whether the merge gate
passes. Fix: `sketch check` and `sketch ready` fail on every problem the merge check fails on (one shared
blocking set, a spec that compares both); a sketch whose variants carry a blocking problem is not offered for a
pick. Order: B286 (disclosure gets an option without data-et-action, the product and all variants pass it)
comes before the pages/sketches merge, together with finding 325.
