# Studio design tooling backlog - parallel plan (2026-10-30)

Goal (Tom): finish the open items of `design-system-actions.md` and `motion.md` as fast as possible, without
Tom. Tom is not there to merge sketches: sketch work stops at `ready` and goes onto the merge queue below.

## Builder status (2026-10-30)

- A1 done (`0c4b8a887`). A2 + Q32 done (`0c307a0c3`); F1 done, auto-merged (`e6fcf97c5`). A3-A5, the `STALE-REPLACE`
  false positive, then exceptions and `handoff` run in one subagent.
- D done (`493d1f6f9` 6.7 and 5.60 rule, `c94f3e095` 6.6). F3 and F4 were already built (token in `colors.css`,
  `UTILITY-CSS` in `RULES`). B, C1, E and G slice 5 run; F 5.51 gets an r2 for Q42; F 5.32 at ready. G slice 4 done (`eebccd5f6`); slice 5 waits for Q41 (how flow lines
  animate). Queued: A 5.39 after A2-A5; F 5.32 (F2 merged by Tom).
- `design check` warns `STALE-REPLACE` on `components/button/button.ts` (`replace(/^<(button|a) /)` matches nothing). Found on the way: `aae2914f3` broke every render of the built CLI
  (`exports is not defined`); fixed in `203aa2c35`.

## Rules for every stream

- One subagent per stream, run the streams at the same time. Inside a stream, work serially: its items touch
  the same files.
- Each stream commits only its own paths (`git add -- <new files>`, `git commit -- <paths>`). Never `git add -A`,
  stash, amend, reset or `checkout --`.
- A typecheck or build error in another stream's uncommitted file is not yours: check your own files with tsc and
  eslint on changed files, and say so in the report.
- Every lib change: a spec that bites, a changeset, docs (`apps/docs/cli/index.md`), no new lint warnings.
- Record each item as built in its plan section, with the commit.

## Stream A - `libs/cli` sketch and complete checks

Serial, all in `system/sketch`, `system/complete.ts`, `inventory*.ts`:

1. 4.47 inventory slice 1 (CLI) - in progress.
2. `sketch ready` refuses a variant that does not load (`exports is not defined` printed "is ready").
3. 5.60 `sketch ready` fails on unused imports, styles or params in the picked variant's closure.
4. 3.39 a component sketch may carry host edits that only change an import.
5. 5.39 the state grid shows empty cells for undrawn state combos, and `sketch check` lists them - if Tom
   decides it (see open decisions).

## Stream B - `libs/cli` MCP and motion endpoint

1. `et design mcp` (design-system.md slice 8), then the `motion_shots` tool (sheet image + JSON).
2. `/__design/motion` over `motionOf` with the shot cache (`serve.ts`), for motion slice 3.

## Stream C - Studio app (`apps/ethlete-studio/src`)

1. 4.47 slice 2: the inventory approval view (marked page, list, approve button). Starts when stream A step 1
   lands; build the UI against the CLI output.
2. Motion slice 3: keyframe strip and timeline. Starts when stream B step 2 lands.
3. 1.2 re-run the 100-cycle frame-reload test and record the result.

## Stream D - agent skill text (`.agents/skills/ethlete-design-exploration`, `libs/agent-rules/content`)

One sonnet subagent, small items: 6.7 reference rule (check first whether it is already in the skill), 5.60
authoring rule, 6.6 critique rule and 5.56 "one scale only" rule if Tom decides them. Then `yarn agents:sync`.

## Stream E - `libs/cli` tokens and embed (only after Tom's decisions)

5.52 `design tokens theme add`, 5.55 `embedPage({ mark, css })`. Separate files from streams A and B.

## Stream F - sketches up to `ready`

One sketch per part; different parts run in parallel, the same part serially. Each stops at `ready` and goes
onto the merge queue. A sketch that builds on an unmerged sketch waits.

1. `components/button` controls into the SDK base (Q32), then the studio override goes away.
2. `elements/canvas-frames`: 2.2 app zoom chip, then 5.32 named frame head, frame box and zoom chip.
3. 5.31 `--surface-pressed` token, then tree-row, disclosure and comment-pin on it.
4. 4.54 `UTILITY-CSS` moves: inbox, comment-pin, pages/sketches, agent-logos, `picker.css`; then register
   `UTILITY-CSS` in `RULES` (stream A owns `RULES`; hand it over).
5. 5.51 contrast numbers in the tokens drawing, if Tom decides it.

## Merge queue (waits for Tom)

Sketches at `ready`, with the round name and the one-line question for Tom. The builder keeps this list current.

- `elements/canvas-frames` + `pages/sketches` r1 "Named frame parts" (`b907cf29d`, 5.32): merge the named exports
  `canvasFrameHead`, `canvasFrameBox`, `canvasZoomChip`, with the app chip on `pages/sketches`? Q43 with the grill.
- `foundations/colors` r1 "Contrast next to each token" (`fdb770514`, 5.51): merge the contrast chips (each token on
  surface, raised and overlay, with its bar)? Also Q42: `--surface-border` is 1.2-1.6:1; hold it to 3:1 or mark it
  exempt as decorative?

## Waits for Tom in the real Studio

- Accept 3.45 (reject and reopen) and 4.43 (toggle and gaps), both built with specs only.
- Section 7 open checks: Rust status-watch reload, `is_stale` footer, shot size on the HiDPI window, round d on
  macOS WebKit and touch.
- 1.5: rebuild and restart Studio; the next panic stack lands in `/tmp/ethlete-studio-panics.log`.

## Stream G - motion runtime (`libs/cli/src/lib/design/motion-*.ts`)

Pulled into this push (Tom, 2026-10-30): motion slice 4 (`spring()`, `interrupt`), then slice 5 (flow lines).
Coordinate with stream B on `serve.ts` and with stream C on the timeline.

## Stream A, after its five steps

Pulled into this push (Tom, 2026-10-30): 4.47 approved exceptions, then the `handoff` status with CI.

## Nothing to build

3.41 (did not reproduce), 4.7 (known limit), 5.21 (parked), 5.23 (SDK issue), 5.24 (done), 6.5 (covered by 4.47).

## Decisions (Tom, 2026-10-30)

- 5.39: the state grid shows an empty cell for each undrawn state combo; `sketch check` lists them. Stream A.
- 5.51: the tokens drawing prints the contrast of each token on each surface. Stream F (sketch).
- 5.52: if a generator already reads the tokens, generate all three theme blocks from that one source; else add
  `design tokens theme add <name> --type --oklch`. Check which first. Stream E.
- 5.55: `embedPage({ mark, css })`, both applied inside the iframe. Stream E.
- 5.56: `design check` warns when both `embedPage({ scale })` and the host's own scale are set. Stream A or E.
- 5.32: `elements/canvas-frames` exports the frame head, the frame box and the zoom chip as named parts. Stream F,
  after 2.2 on the same part.
- 6.6: a skill rule: before `ready`, critique hierarchy, spacing, form nesting and host context; no render gate.
  Stream D.
- 5.51 / Q42: `--surface-border` (1.2-1.6:1) is marked decorative and exempt from the 3:1 non-text bar (WCAG
  1.4.11: it only separates surfaces). Controls with a visible boundary (inputs, focus) keep their own 3:1 tokens.
