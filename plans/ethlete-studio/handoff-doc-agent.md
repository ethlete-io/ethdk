# Doc agent handoff (2026-11-10, day shift, third part, from ethlete-sdk-a6 / tmux claude-2)

Run `/doc-agent` first. The human is **afk** (said "afk"): collect design questions, one chat line per event, no round
until they say they are back.

## Sessions

- Linux builder: ethlete-sdk-3e in tmux `claude-3@ethlete-sdk`, role builder.
- Mac builder: tmux `claude@ethlete-sdk` on ethlete-mac (told to restart itself with `--role builder`; check with a
  pane capture). Send work with a file: `scp -q /tmp/x.txt ethlete-mac:/tmp/x.txt && ssh ethlete-mac 'zsh -lc "cd
~/dev/ethlete-sdk && node .agents/skills/ethlete-agent-sessions/agent-sessions.mjs send doc-agent --to claude <
/tmp/x.txt"'`. Never put the message inline in the ssh string: backticks ran `git pull` and `git push` on the Mac once.
- Start the Mac mailbox wait in the background at once:
  `ssh ethlete-mac 'zsh -lc "cd ~/dev/ethlete-sdk && node .agents/skills/ethlete-agent-sessions/agent-sessions.mjs inbox doc-agent --wait 3500"'`

## State

- Findings 706-716 in `design-to-code.md`; as-built notes for 706, 706a, 707, 710, 714, 715. ADRs 0252 (Studio does not
  jump into an @edit sketch) and 0253 (no old design → sketch with only `new`), both `open: B249`.
- Binding order (ADR 0234, STATUS "Gerade in Arbeit"): B249 is item 1. Finding 711: the doc agent had queued only
  findings; never queue tool work ahead of the STATUS order unless CI is red or it blocks the item.
- Linux builder queue: CI run 42826707435 (query-clock-edges, real run 1 of 2 owed), then B249: missing harness =
  "Nicht baubereit" (in an opus subagent), browser check of "Sketch öffnen", CLI removal (apiLevel 8), go.json hook
  rule, data migration, docs and skills, gutter skip in `pages/sketches`. Pushed B249 slices: 498d82393, c58f340a0,
  5d7bcee34, 1bacbcefa, a3890721a.
- Mac builder queue: 713 (pre-commit label-spec lint), 712 (check-system-sketch port 0), `realOf()` nearest existing
  ancestor in `libs/cli` `package-root.ts`. Then tool backlog: 708, 709 (sketch first), B482.
- Decided by the doc agent (technical): 714 assert `>= 18000` is the exact bound; the edge fractions run as parallel
  CI jobs (ADR 0240). B249 Q1 (status words, ADR 0041) and Q3 (ADR 0209 stands, agent picks `new` with ADR note).
- Open: pages/start EDIT-OLD-NOT-FOUND — the builder says whether an ADR covers it (then agent pick) or it waits for
  the human. 714 tool fix and 710 sweep need a slow factor measured from CI, not 13.

## Side work

- Issue ethlete-io/ethdk#3172 (tooltip on touch): decided by the human (long press opens; toggletip keeps the
  button trigger, docs get an icon-button example; tooltip docs name the toggletip for must-see hints). A new session
  in tmux `claude-4@ethlete-sdk` builds it (brief /tmp/issue-3172-brief.txt) and reports to ethlete-sdk-a6. The
  human comments on the issue, not the agents.

## Open questions for the human

None. The human is afk again (said "afk" after the ADR 0254 round): collect questions.
