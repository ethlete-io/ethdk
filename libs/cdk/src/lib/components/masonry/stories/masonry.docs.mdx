# Masonry

A masonry layout component. It is a grid layout that supports multiple columns with items of varying height. It is a great way to display a collection of images or other content.
Imported by adding the `MasonryImports` array to the `imports` array of your standalone component.

**Important:**

- Images must either have a fixed height and width or a aspect ratio set in order for the masonry layout to work correctly.
- Dont set the masonry item's width smaller than the column width. All items will scaled automatically to fit the column width.
- A **unique** key must be set for each masonry item. This is used to track the items and to reduce the number of DOM changes.
- If a ngFor is used to render the masonry items, the trackBy function must be set to avoid performance issues.
- Avoid placing ever chaning content inside the masonry. This might cause the masonry to re-render and cause performance issues.
- Avoid changing the masonry component's width if possible.
- Aviod changing styles of the masonry and masonry items. Only style the content **you placed** inside the masonry items.

## Usage
