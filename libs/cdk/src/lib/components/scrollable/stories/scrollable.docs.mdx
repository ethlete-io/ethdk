# Scrollable

The scrollable component is a wrapper for a content that might be too long to fit on the screen.
It can display buttons to scroll to the top or bottom (or left & right) of the content. It can also display masks to fade out the overflowing content.
If enabled, the scrollable can be scrolled using mouse drag.

### Basic usage

```html
<et-scrollable>
  <div class="my-scrollable-item"></div>
  <div class="my-scrollable-item"></div>
  <div class="my-scrollable-item"></div>
</et-scrollable>
```
