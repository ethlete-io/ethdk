# Label

The label component is used to label a form field. Imported by adding the `LabelImports` array to your standalone component's `imports` array.

## Render a suffix

The label can be rendered with a suffix.
By default, the suffix is hidden for screen readers. This can be changed by setting the `showToScreenReader` attribute to `true`.

```html
<et-label>
  I am required
  <span etLabelSuffix> * </span>
</et-label>
```
