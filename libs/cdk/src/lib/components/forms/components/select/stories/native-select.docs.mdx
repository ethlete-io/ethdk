# Native select

The native select component is a wrapper around the browser's native select element. It is used to select one option from a list of options.
For native selects there is no way to detect if the menu is open or closed.
Imported by adding the `NativeSelectImports` array to the `imports` array of your standalone component.

Unlike the regular select, the native select component does not transform the option values to strings.

## Usage

```html
<et-select-field [formControl]="fg">
  <et-label>Native Select</et-label>

  <et-native-select>
    <et-native-select-option value="string">String</et-native-select-option>
    <et-native-select-option [value]="true">Boolean</et-native-select-option>
    <et-native-select-option [value]="2">Number 2</et-native-select-option>
    <et-native-select-option [value]="undefined">Undefined</et-native-select-option>
  </et-native-select>
</et-select-field>
```

## Adding a classic "Please choose" option

```html
<et-native-select-option disabled hidden>Please choose</et-native-select-option>
```

import { ArgsTable, PRIMARY_STORY } from '@storybook/addon-docs';

<ArgsTable story={PRIMARY_STORY} />
