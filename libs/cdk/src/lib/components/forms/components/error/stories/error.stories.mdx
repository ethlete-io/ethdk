# Error

The error component is rendered automatically by every dynamic form group or field.
It is always rendered so that it can be animated in and out.
It can be visually hidden by setting the `hideErrorMessage` to `true` on the respective form group or field.

## Misc

Below is a list of elements and their conditional classes.

`<et-error>`

#### `et-error--has-errors`

> Applied when the error has content inside.
