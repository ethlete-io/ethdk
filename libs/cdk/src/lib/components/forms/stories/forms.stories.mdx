# About forms

Forms are split into groups and fields. Groups are used to group fields together. Fields are wrappers around inputs.
A group is not always necessary. Radio buttons are a good example of a input type that requires a group.
For checkboxes, a group is optional. It makes sense to group similar checkboxes together, but it is not required.

## Form groups

Form groups come in two flavors: static and dynamic.
Static groups are for presentation and a11y purposes only.
Dynamic groups on the other hand are places where the `[formControl]` directive should be placed.
They display errors. This behavior can be disabled by setting the `hideErrorMessage` property to `true`.

## Form fields

Like form groups, form fields come in two flavors: static and dynamic.
The same rules apply as for form groups.
It also applies conditional classes.

#### `cdk-focused`

> Applied when the input is focused.

#### `cdk-mouse-focused`

> Applied in addition to `cdk-focused` when the input is focused by mouse.

#### `cdk-keyboard-focused`

> Applied in addition to `cdk-focused` when the input is focused by keyboard.

#### `cdk-touch-focused`

> Applied in addition to `cdk-focused` when the input is focused by touch.

#### `cdk-program-focused`

> Applied in addition to `cdk-focused` when the input is focused by program logic.

## Writeable input

Dynamic form groups and fields extend the `WriteableInputDirective` directive.
This directive provides the ControlValueAccessor required for Angular forms to work.
It also applies conditional classes based on the state of the input.

#### `et-required`

> Applied when the input has a required or requiredTrue validator.

#### `et-disabled`

> Applied when the input is disabled.

#### `et-value-is-truthy`

> Applied when the input's value is truthy (`true`, `"some string"`, `123` etc.).

#### `et-value-is-falsy`

> Applied when the input's value is falsy (`false`, `""`, `0` etc.).

#### `et-empty`

> Applied when the input is empty. The values `null`, `undefined` and `""` are considered empty.

#### `et-should-display-error`

> Applied when the input should display an error message. For this to happen, the input must be blurred at least once.

#### `et-autofilled`

> Applied when the input is autofilled.

Default Angular classes (`ng-touched`, `ng-invalid` etc.) are also applied.

## Prefix and suffix

Supported inputs can have a prefix and/or suffix.
The prefix and suffix are placed inside the input component.

### Prefix

The prefix is placed before the input.
Add it by setting the `etInputPrefix` property on the element you want to use as a prefix.

### Suffix

The suffix is placed after the input.
Add it by setting the `etInputSuffix` property on the element you want to use as a suffix.

### Helper directives

You can use the `*etIfInputEmpty` and `*etIfInputFilled` structural directives to conditionally render prefixes and suffixes based on the state of the input.
