# @ethlete/timetrack

## 0.1.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- [#3055](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/pull/3055) [`bc17623`](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/commit/bc17623d34aaabdf9cb26d89674a71d4ca3f2a41) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Add `@ethlete/timetrack`: the time-tracking core's data model, host ports, and the `sessionize()`
  and `attribute()` correlation steps that turn observed activity into issue-attributed blocks.

- [#3055](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/pull/3055) [`a4739ec`](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/commit/a4739ec1eb923c89585d3998c2084cec802a1945) Thanks [@github-actions](https://github.com/apps/github-actions)! - Complete the deterministic pipeline with `mergeBlocks()`, `roundDurations()`, `checkDay()`,
  `describeWork()`, `propose()` and `correlateDay()` — a window of events now becomes rounded,
  described `WorklogProposal`s carrying their evidence chain.

- [`154c5cf`](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/commit/154c5cf65ebeb9627437fb50197c08d3839646fe) Thanks [@TomTomB](https://github.com/TomTomB)! - Add the Jira provider over `TimetrackTransport` — issue lookup, the cursor-paged JQL search and
  hierarchy discovery — plus the merge-request/issue-view and recurring-pattern rungs of the
  attribution ladder.

- [`cce0cba`](https://github.com/ethlete-io/ethdk/commit/cce0cba53ec1fbb3fb7b312cee5f5891e92f0815) Thanks [@TomTomB](https://github.com/TomTomB)! - Add the Tempo read side: work-attribute discovery, a paged worklog reader, `subtractForeignTime()`
  so a re-sync cannot log an hour twice, and `planTempoSync()` for the create/update/delete preview.
